   - Error alert handling
   - State management with @State and @Observable

2. ✅ EmptyStateView
   - Initial state before folder selection
   - Large folder icon with descriptive text
   - Prominent "Select Folder" button
   - Clean, centered layout

3. ✅ ScanProgressView
   - Linear progress indicator
   - Current path display
   - Cancel button
   - Progress percentage display

4. ✅ ScanResultsView
   - Summary card with statistics
   - Table view with build folders
   - Checkbox selection column
   - Project name, type, size, last modified, path columns
   - Action buttons (Select All, Deselect All, Remove Selected)
   - Dynamic button states

#### UI Features:
- SwiftUI declarative UI
- Table component with sortable columns
- Responsive layout (900x600 minimum)
- System color scheme support
- SF Symbols icons
- Modern macOS design patterns
- Toolbar integration
