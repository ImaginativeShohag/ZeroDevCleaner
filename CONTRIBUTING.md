- **Use a clear and descriptive title**
- **Provide a detailed description** of the suggested enhancement
- **Explain why this enhancement would be useful**
- **List examples** of how it would be used

### Adding Support for New Project Types

Want to add support for a new build system? Great! Here's what you need:

1. **Add to ProjectType enum** in `Models/ProjectType.swift`
2. **Add validation logic** in `Services/ProjectValidator.swift`
3. **Add tests** for the new project type
4. **Update README.md** to document the new support

### Code Contributions

1. **Fork the repository**
2. **Create a feature branch** (`git checkout -b feature/amazing-feature`)
3. **Make your changes**
4. **Add tests** for your changes
5. **Ensure all tests pass** (`Cmd+U` in Xcode)
6. **Commit your changes** (see [Commit Guidelines](#commit-guidelines))
7. **Push to your branch** (`git push origin feature/amazing-feature`)
8. **Open a Pull Request**

## Development Setup

## Coding Guidelines

### Swift Style

- **Swift 6.0** with strict concurrency enabled
- **SwiftUI** for all UI components
- **@Observable** macro for state management
- **Structured concurrency** with async/await
- **No third-party dependencies**

### Architecture Principles

1. **Component Reusability**
   - Never pass ViewModels to reusable components
   - Components should be pure SwiftUI views with bindings/closures
   - Keep business logic in ViewModels and Services

2. **Separation of Concerns**
   - Models: Data structures only
   - Services: Business logic (scanning, deletion, validation)
   - ViewModels: State management and orchestration
   - Views: Pure UI, no business logic

3. **Error Handling**
   - Use typed errors (`ZeroDevCleanerError`)
   - Provide user-friendly error messages
   - Log errors with OSLog for debugging

4. **Concurrency**
   - Use `@MainActor` for UI-related code
   - Mark protocols with `Sendable` where appropriate
   - Use structured concurrency (Tasks, async/await)

### Code Style

```swift
// ✅ Good: Clear naming, proper error handling
func scanDirectory(at url: URL) async throws -> [BuildFolder] {
    guard fileManager.fileExists(atPath: url.path) else {
        throw ZeroDevCleanerError.fileNotFound(url)
    }

    // Implementation
}

// ❌ Bad: Generic naming, no error handling
func scan(path: String) -> [Any]? {
    // Implementation
}
```

### Testing

- Write tests for new features
- Maintain test coverage above 80%
- Use descriptive test names: `test_scanDirectory_withValidPath_returnsResults()`
- Mock external dependencies

```swift
func test_scanDirectory_withValidPath_returnsResults() async throws {
    // Arrange
    let scanner = FileScanner()
    let testURL = URL(fileURLWithPath: "/path/to/test")

    // Act
    let results = try await scanner.scanDirectory(at: testURL)

    // Assert
    XCTAssertFalse(results.isEmpty)
}
```
