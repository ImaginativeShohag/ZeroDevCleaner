## Critical Path

The following tasks are on the critical path and cannot be parallelized:

1. Phase 1: Foundation → Must be done first
2. Phase 2: Core Services → Depends on Phase 1
3. Phase 3: ViewModel → Depends on Phase 2
4. Phase 4: Enhanced MVP UI → Depends on Phase 3

After Phase 4 (MVP), some tasks can be parallelized:
- Phase 5 (Enhanced UI) and Phase 6 (Error Handling) can overlap
- Phase 7 (Testing) should happen throughout but intensive testing after Phase 6
- Phase 8 (Polish) and Phase 9 (Documentation) can partially overlap

## Risk Mitigation

### Risk: File system permissions
- **Mitigation**: Tackle early in Phase 2
- **Testing**: Test on restricted folders immediately
- **Fallback**: Provide clear instructions for granting access

### Risk: Performance with large trees
- **Mitigation**: Test with large directories in Phase 2
- **Testing**: Profile early and often
- **Fallback**: Add depth limit option

### Risk: False positives in validation
- **Mitigation**: Test with many real projects in Phase 2
- **Testing**: Create test suite with various project structures
- **Fallback**: Add manual verification option

### Risk: UI complexity
- **Mitigation**: Start with simple UI in Phase 4
- **Testing**: Get feedback early
- **Fallback**: Simplify if too complex

---

## Decision Points

### After Phase 4 (MVP)
**Decision**: Is the Enhanced MVP functional and polished enough?
- **Yes** → Continue to Phase 5
- **No** → Fix critical issues before proceeding

### After Phase 6 (Error Handling)
**Decision**: Is the app stable enough for beta testing?
- **Yes** → Start beta testing while continuing development
- **No** → Focus on stability before moving forward

### After Phase 7 (Testing)
**Decision**: Are we ready for release?
- **Yes** → Proceed to Phase 8 and 9
- **No** → Fix critical bugs and re-test

- Code coverage >80%
- Scans >1000 folders/second
- Memory usage <100MB

---

## Flexibility

This plan is flexible and should be adapted based on:
- Developer experience level
- Available time
- Discovered complexities
- User feedback (after MVP)
- Technical challenges

Feel free to:
- Adjust time estimates based on actual progress
- Re-prioritize tasks as needed
- Add or remove features
- Change the order of non-dependent phases

The key is to **complete Phase 4 (Enhanced MVP)** first, then gather feedback before continuing with enhancements.
