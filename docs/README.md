### For Human Developers üë®‚Äçüíª

To begin implementation, follow these steps:

1.  **Understand the Vision**: Read **[01-project-overview.md](./01-project-overview.md)** to get a high-level understanding of the project's goals.
2.  **Study the Architecture**: Review **[02-technical-architecture.md](./02-technical-architecture.md)** and **[03-ui-ux-design.md](./03-ui-ux-design.md)** to understand the technical and visual foundation.
3.  **Follow the Roadmap**: Use **[05-implementation-phases.md](./05-implementation-phases.md)** as your primary guide for the development process.
4.  **Consult the Task List**: Refer to **[04-task-breakdown.md](./04-task-breakdown.md)** for detailed, actionable subtasks for each phase.

## Project Summary

**ZeroDevCleaner** is a native macOS application that helps developers reclaim disk space by finding and safely removing build artifacts from Android and iOS projects.

### Key Features
- Scan any directory for Android `build/` folders and iOS `.build/` folders
- Validate that folders are part of real development projects
- Display results with project paths and sizes
- Select multiple folders for deletion
- Safely move folders to Trash (not permanent deletion)
- Modern, native macOS UI built with SwiftUI

### Technology
- **Language**: Swift 6
- **Framework**: SwiftUI
- **State Management**: @Observable macro
- **Concurrency**: Structured concurrency (Task, async/await)
- **Minimum Target**: macOS 15.0
- **Architecture**: MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) with co-located ViewModels

### Time Estimate
- **Enhanced MVP (with good-to-have features)**: 58 hours
- **Full Release (Polished, tested, ready to ship)**: 88-108 hours

### Development Phases
1. Foundation (3-4 hours)
2. Core Services (15-20 hours)
3. ViewModel Layer (4-6 hours)
4. Enhanced MVP UI - **MVP** (20-28 hours)
5. Enhanced UI (8-10 hours)
6. Error Handling (6-8 hours)
7. Testing & QA (12-16 hours)
8. Performance & Polish (6-8 hours)
9. Documentation & Release (6-8 hours)

## Next Steps

To begin implementation:

1. **Set up your development environment**
   - Ensure you have Xcode 15+ installed
   - Have a macOS 11.0+ machine for testing

2. **Follow Phase 1: Foundation**
   - Create the Xcode project
   - Set up the folder structure
   - Implement data models

3. **Progress through the phases**
   - Follow the tasks in order
   - Test as you go
   - Commit frequently to Git

4. **Reach Enhanced MVP (End of Phase 4)**
   - You'll have a working prototype with key enhancements
   - Test with real projects
   - Gather feedback before continuing

## Questions or Issues?

If you encounter issues or have questions while implementing:

1. Review the relevant documentation section
2. Check the technical architecture for design decisions
3. Refer to the task breakdown for acceptance criteria
4. Consider the risks and mitigations outlined in the overview

## Document Maintenance

These documents are living documents and should be updated as:
- Requirements change
- Technical decisions are made
- Issues are discovered
- The project evolves

Keep them in sync with the actual implementation.
